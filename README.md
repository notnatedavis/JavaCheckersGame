Java Checkers for Deliverable 2 SER216
A lot of the code probably needs revising and was done in less than optimal time.
I would highly suggest rewriting the capturing mechanic. For some reason if moving 
a piece into a capturable position, it registers the piece as captured and wipes
from the board. (oops)
